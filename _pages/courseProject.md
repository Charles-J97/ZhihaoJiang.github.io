## CPU Development Based on Microinstructions
* Duration: Feb â€“ May 2019
* Institution: Southeast University
* Main Tasks:
  * Developed s set of basic registers to implement basic instructions such as Load, Store, Add, Subtract, And, Or, etc. with VHDL.
  * Designed the ALU which contained basic arithmetic and logic algorithms. Constructed the Control Unit in which an opcode could be converted to a set of corresponding microinstructions whose combination could be interpreted as a formal instruction.

## Vending Machine Source Code Design Using VHDL
* Duration: Aug - Oct 2018
* Institution: Southeast University
* Main Tasks:
  * Wrote the source code of a vending machine with functions such as the selection of merchandise type and quantity, payment, and changing.
  * Used the idea of state machine to represent the various states of the vending machine. The program in each state represented different functions that the state was going to finish. At the same time, each output state was displayed by LED lights, and each number was represented by a set of sevensegment decoders.
  * Wrote the program to eliminate jitter when each button was pressed. At the same time, a series of specific flags were set to avoid undesirable consequences caused by a long-time press.
