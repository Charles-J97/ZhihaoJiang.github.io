## CPU Development Based on Microinstructions
* Time: Feb â€“ May 2019
* Institution: Southeast University
* Main Tasks:
  * Developed s set of basic registers to implement basic instructions such as Load, Store, Add, Subtract, And, Or, etc. with VHDL.
  * Designed the ALU which contained basic arithmetic and logic algorithms. Constructed the Control Unit in which an opcode could be converted to a set of corresponding microinstructions whose combination could be interpreted as a formal instruction.
