<br/>
**Welcome to my personal page!**
<br/>
<br/>
My name is Zhihao Jiang, an incoming master student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
I am interested in back end development and distributed system. Furthermore, I have learnt relational database like Mysql and no-sql database like Redis and HBase. As to the message queue, I knew how to use rabbitMQ, rocketMQ, and kafka. Besides, I have finished several server development projects with Golang(Gin) and Java(Spring Boot & Spring Cloud). I also knew distributed algorithms and used them in my projects.
